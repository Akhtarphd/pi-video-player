Strategy for fireplace videos

fireplace.sh
    reads video name from /tmp/nextVideo and deletes the file
    If the file does not exist on startup it will loop until it is
    does not display if /tmp/StopFireplace exists
    If /tmp/StopFireplace and /tmp/nextVideo does not exist, it will loop the same video
    if /tmp/nextVideo is found it will start playing the contents.

controlVideo.py
    Read the Videos from /home/hbarta/Videos and write the first
    one to /tmp/nextVideo.
    Monitor the pushbutton. On a short press, it will:
     - write the next video to /tmp/nextVideo
     - delete /tmp/StopFireplace
     - killall omxplayer (to get fireplace.sh to read the video name.)
    On a long press it will 
     - create /tmp/StopFireplace
