Purpose:
  SWMBO decorates her office with a cardboard fireplace over the
  holidays. She uses brick patterned wrapping paper and a picture of a
  fireplace. I thought it would be very cool to use a retired monitor
  to loop a video of a fireplace (running pn a Raspberry Pi Zero) and
  use that to replace the picture.

  The next step is to be able to cycle through videos (and to stop the
  video when I want to do something at the console.) For that I chose to
  use a shell script operating based on some files written to /tmp (*)
  and a Python script to read inputs from a GPIO pin and manage the files.

  (*) This runs on a Pi configured for a readonly file system but /tmp
  is in RAM and can be written.

Status:
  Shell and python script are written and presently under active
  development. At present it seems to work but the Python script writes a
  number of error messages and the shell script puts out some unnecessary
  messages.

Bugs/TODO:
  Videos are read from my home directory. (/home/hbarta/Videos) It is
  left as an upgrade to use the $HOME directory or specify a directory
  on the command line.

  Abstract the press/long press functionality out of myFallingCallback()
Strategy for fireplace videos

 fireplace.sh
    Reads video name from /tmp/nextVideo and then deletes the file.
    If the file does not exist on startup it will loop until it is.
    It does not play the video if /tmp/StopFireplace exists.  If both
    /tmp/StopFireplace and /tmp/nextVideo do not exist, it will loop
    the same video (if a video name has already been read in.)

 
  controlVideo.py
      Read the Videos from /home/hbarta/Videos and write the first
      one to /tmp/nextVideo.
      Monitor the pushbutton. On a short press, it will:
       - write the next video to /tmp/nextVideo
       - delete /tmp/StopFireplace
       - killall omxplayer (to get fireplace.sh to read the video name.)
      On a long press it will 
       - create /tmp/StopFireplace
